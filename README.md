# Forgiveness
Forgiveness is a narrative-driven puzzle adventure game about regret, memory, and self-acceptance.

You play as Emma, a young woman burdened with guilt over her harsh words toward her grandmother before her passing. After the cremation, Emma receives a mysterious amulet—a gift from her grandmother, carrying a purpose she doesn’t yet understand.

Soon after, Emma encounters Alter Emma, a shadowy version of herself that embodies her deepest regrets. The alter reveals that the amulet has the power to shift between the real world and the spirit world. To find peace, Emma must follow this path, confronting puzzles rooted in places from her childhood and memories with her grandmother.
